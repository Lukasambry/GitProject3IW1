# Introduction

### Welcome

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project.

### Tell them why they should read your guidelines.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Explain what kinds of contributions you are looking for.

> Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.


# Ground Rules
### Behavior

> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.


# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through issues.

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help. Everyone is a beginner at first

>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix

>1. Create your own branch
>2. Do the changes in your branch
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request respecting our contribution guidelines.


# How to report a bug
### Security disclosures

>
> 1. What version of the language are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
